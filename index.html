        <h2>How Fostering Helps</h2>
        <p>Fostering provides pets with a safe place to heal, grow, and learn to trust again. It also helps shelters free up space and resources, giving more animals a second chance at life. Every foster home is a step closer to a forever family for a pet in need.</p>
